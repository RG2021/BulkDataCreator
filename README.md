## ðŸ“– About

The **Dynamics CRM Bulk Data Creator** is an XrmToolBox plugin designed to help you create large volumes of **realistic, customizable test data** directly in your **Dynamics 365 / Dataverse** environment.

Instead of manually creating sample records or importing static spreadsheets, this tool lets you define **data generation templates** using a mix of:

- **Bogus Faker library tokens** â€” for realistic names, addresses, phone numbers, dates, and more.
- **Custom mock tokens** â€” for specialized formats like sequences, lookups, and controlled random values.
